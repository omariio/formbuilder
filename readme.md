# About

Hey sailor, let's build some forms with Angular.

Right now I'm thinking that this particular module will be extended with a more user-friendly
way of loading preset schemas so that it can easily upload custom (semantic) data.

Everything is client side so that it can be dropped in to webpages we don't control (see?)
